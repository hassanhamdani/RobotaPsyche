<h2> Project Improvements over the Homework </h2>


1 - Adding color and resizing Fiods 
Add some color based on the energy of the fiod, and use energy as a parameter in the vertex of the fiod itself to gradually make them bigger or smaller

2 - More Consumables
Need to add more food and poison as the program runs for better and more naturally continuity. Use code from the inital consumable spawning and run it every few seconds. [ millis() ]

3 - DNA 
Ideas for what can be the DNA in these Fiods. Need 2 atleast: consumable choice , reproduction threshold, ... ? 


4 - Evolution
Make a random fiod evolve. Choose one randomly from the list and then add another layer of randomness to choose if it will evolve or not. [ choose from list -> yes or no ]. To make them actually better, ill make the random function of consumable choosing more biased towards food, and reduce energy required for reproduction. The reproduced fiods of evolved fiods are also evolved. Would be cool to see all of them evovled and have no more regular fiods. [ Complete natural selection ]
