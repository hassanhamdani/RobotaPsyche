AI and Consciousness

What is consciousness? 

Philosophy: John Searle’s Chinese Room experiment. You have a room where you can only input messages and get the output. You have to figure out whether the person inside actually knows Chinese, or is faking it.

Explained through neuroscience, “Integrated Information” theory, where consciousness arises from the interconnectivity of the different brain parts. Hard to model due to the volume of connections involved, but has offered a measurement system to differentiate between awake and asleep persons.

100,000 neurons and the one billion connections, or synapses, between them in a cubic millimetre of mouse brain — a sample that’s roughly the size of a grain of sand.

The microscopes ran continuously for five months, collecting more than 100 million images of 25,000 slices of mouse visual cortex, each just 40 nanometres thick

More than 30 years of satellite images of Earth, collected by the Landsat missions, take up only about 1.3 petabytes,

Explained through Antonio demasio’s theory for consciousness.





Programming a robot based on this theory. 

Animal-like consciousness in a robot. 



It definitely seems very plausible that AI can reach consciousness, atleast animal-like. Therefore, a discussion on the rights and freedom of AI becomes important. 


Star Trek - “Measure of a Man”

Three main characters, Capt. Picard, Bruce Maddox, Data.

Data is a one of a kind android and Bruce wishes to dismantle him in order to learn more and replicate androids, but this procedure is possibly “fatal” for Data.

As Data is not sentient, Bruce argues, he is property of Star Fleet and Bruce has full rights over it. Picard asks what makes a being sentient.

1- Intelligence, demonstrated as Data is able to learn and understand and cope with new situations. 
2- Self - aware, Data knows that he is in a court room, where his rights are challenged, his freedom and life are both in question.
3- Consciousness, if Bruce is able to dismantle Data and replicate him successfully, 100s of 1000s of androids, if they show even a slightest bit of consciousness, they are now a race. If the freedom of a whole race is put in question, then it becomes a matter of ruling that andriods are destined to live in slavery.

1 - How to make mass production ethical in this case?
2 - Do you think AI today exhibit animal-like consciousness?

Thought experiment

We have a robot and a human in a life threatening situation. The robot can either choose to save itself or save the human. All the robot's memories are backed up on a cloud drive. Should the robot sacrifice itself? Human’s life automatically becomes more valuable than a robots’.
