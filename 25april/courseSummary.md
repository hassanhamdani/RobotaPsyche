<b>Summarize the Course</b>


This course has been an enlightening experience overall. It lived up to its curious, 
oxymoronic name “Robota Psyche”. Learning how to create these robot simulations was 
lots of fun. The first few readings really helped me understand the idea of “coding” 
certain emotions into robots and also changed my perspective on how robots and most 
animals aren’t that different at the end of the day from a third-person perspective. 
As the semester progressed, I was able to pick up on other aspects surrounding the 
topic, not just how to emulate emotions into robots, but also get into much deeper 
conversations about consciousness and morality when it comes to these synthetic 
beings. The most crucial observation I made through this course is that technology 
is approaching a point where we may be able to view robots as a means to understand 
us humans even better. For example, getting into a discussion on how to code in the 
emotion of being angry leads to a much deeper analysis of what human anger really 
is. Trying to understand ourselves with technology as a mirror is a great skill that 
this course offers. It ties in with multiple other fields, like military, healthcare 
etc, and I can really begin to realize the potential impact these robots have and 
how they will completely mold a new future for us. Talking about these impacts leads
to discussions on how economic structures will be developed with the advent of such 
technology. This course has not only prepared me better for the future and understand 
the consequences of our interactions with technology, but also provided a unique lens 
through which I view humans as well.
