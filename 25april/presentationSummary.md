Summarize the Presentation


My presentation was focused on the idea of programming consciousness. 
Consciousness is a very metaphysical concept by nature, but programming 
it requires a more scientific approach. This presentation was a great way 
for me to do some research on the concept of consciousness through 
philosophy and neuroscience. When it came to programming consciousness 
through just mapping the neurons of the brain in a synthetic environment, 
I quickly realized it was a dead-end, as the computational power needed is 
simply not available right now. Further research led me to DeMasio’s theory 
of consciousness, where he breaks the term down into three concrete fields, 
protoself, core consciousness, and extended consciousness. The reason why 
my research ended when I found this theory is because this was the first 
scientifically based study of consciousness that seemed somewhat “programmable”. 
My studies as a computer science major really helped here. I realized that human 
consciousness is still a long shot, but animal-like consciousness, or core 
consciousness as DeMasio describes is very much attainable. When connecting it 
to the earlier part of the semester, I remembered that we had several discussions 
on the topic of how some of these tiny robots could be programmed to act like 
cockroaches for example. After showing how animal-like consciousness is very much 
achievable, I wrote about the topic of rights of androids. For this I used a classic 
episode from Star Trek, Measure of a Man, where Picard defines sentience to be a 
combination of intelligence, self-awareness and consciousness, and how the android 
Data, has these properties. In my discussion questions, I furthered this idea by 
asking about the ethics of mass production of robots and how companies that produce 
such robots should operate. These discussions, as usual, were very fruitful.
