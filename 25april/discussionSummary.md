<b>Summarize the Discussion</b>

I led the discussion of the talk by Ben Fry, Eyeo2012, who looked at 
this junction of technology and art. His talk was structured around 
the ideas of order and chaos, and the most important take-away from 
that was how our imagination is a strong tool in finding or perceiving 
order in chaos, from the example of Fractal Invaders. Along with AI 
tools that were used to create organic looking art pieces, he also 
mentioned the algorithm he had developed himself to create coded art, 
and signified the importance of involving some form of randomness to 
his code to really make them an artwork. His talk included a review of 
several such works, like the simulated Braitenberg machines to draw 
tissue artwork, and the 10 print algorithm to showcase how simple algorithms 
can form complex designs. Another key point of all these artworks was that 
this art was somehow emergent, in other words, the program had to run for a 
while before we can really start seeing the designs and patterns that are 
being formed as a result of these randomized algorithms.
